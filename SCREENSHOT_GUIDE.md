# 📸 Screenshot Guide for Finanswer

## Quick Steps to Add Your Screenshots

### 1. Save Your Screenshots
Take the two screenshots you showed me and save them as:

- **First screenshot** → `docs/screenshots/main_interface.png`
  - Shows the initial Finanswer interface with "Analyze Current Page" button
  
- **Second screenshot** → `docs/screenshots/detailed_analysis.png`
  - Shows the analysis results with "Positive (33.7%)" sentiment

### 2. Add to Git
Once you've saved the PNG files, run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Finanswer extension with screenshots"
```
